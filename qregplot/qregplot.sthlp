{title:Description}

{phang}{cmd:qregplot} graphs the coefficients of a quantile regression produced by various 
programs that produce quantile coefficients including, qreg, bsqreg, sqreg,
mmqreg, smqreg, sivqr, and rifhdreg (for unconditional quantiles).{p_end}

{phang}{cmd:qregplot} works in a similar way as {help grqreg}, but provides added options
to give the user more control on the creation of the requested figures, also allowing 
for the use of factor notation. {p_end}

{phang}The command works as follows.{p_end}

{p 8 6} Step 1. It gathers all the information of a previously
estimated model (for example via {help qreg}). This information is used as template
for the estimation of quantile regression models across the distribution. {p_end}

{p 8 6} Step 2. Using the information from Step 1, {cmd:qregplot} estimates {cmd:N} 
quantile regressions following the same specification as the original model.
One can select which quantiles will be used for the estimation of this models.  {p_end}

{p 8 6} Step 3. Once all coefficients, and CI are stored, {cmd:qregplot} plots all requested coefficients
using a {cmd:twoway rarea} for plotting CI, combined with {cmd:twoway line} for plotting the point estimates. 
Each figure is stored temporarily as a graph in memory. {p_end}

{p 8 6} Step 3b. If requested, OLS coefficients and CI are added to each figure in step 3. {p_end}

{p 8 6} Step 4. If more than 1 variable is requested for plotting, 
all plots from Step 3 are combined using {cmd: graph combine}.{p_end}

{phang} The only exception to this process is {help sqreg}. When used after this
command, coefficients are collected from sqreg output, rather than reestimated. {p_end}

{phang} Standard errors are estimated based on the original command specifications. For example. If 
{cmd: qreg} was first estimated using {cmd:vce(robust)}, {cmd:qregplot} will use 
the same type of standard errors for plotting {p_end}

{phang} Since the most time consuming part of quantile regressions is the estimation 
of the qregressions themselves, specially if using bootstrap standard errors, 
one can request {cmd:qregplot} to store all coefficients and CI in memory using the option 
estore({it:name}). The advantage of doing this is that plots can be created using the stored coefficients
directly. {p_end}

{phang} In all cases, CI are plotted automatically using the same level of confidence as the original 
estimation specification (typically 95%) {p_end}

{synoptset 30 tabbed}{...}

{marker {cmd:Options}}{...}
{synopthdr :{cmd:Options}}
{synoptline}

{synopt:{opt varlist}} Select variables that will be plotted. If none is provided, 
all coefficients except the intercept, will be plotted. This accepts factor notation. {p_end}

{synopt:{cmdab:q:uantiles(numlist)}} Indicates which quantiles to use for plotting. One can use
any {help numlist} to do so. The default is quantile(10(5)90). This is ignored after {cmd: sqreg}. {p_end}
  
{synopt:{cmdab:cons}} Requests the intercept to be plotted.{p_end}

{synopt:{cmdab:ols}} Requests to include in the graph the coefficients and CI for the standard
ols model (via {help regress}).{p_end}

{synopt:{cmdab:olsopt(regress options)}} Used to provide additional information to estimate the model
via {help regress}. For example, {cmd:olsopt(robust)} request OLS regression to 
estimate the model using robust standard errors.{p_end}

{synopt:{cmdab:seed}(seed number)} If one used {help bsqreg}, seed can be used to set the same seed
number for each quantile replication. {p_end}

{synopt:{cmdab:raopt}{cmd:(}{it:rarea options}{cmd:)}} 
Provides options to be used in the "twoway rarea" part of the graph. This controls 
the aspects of the Confidence intervals.
The default options are pstyle(p1) fintensity(30) lwidth(none)
{p_end}

{synopt:{cmdab:lnopt}{cmd:(}{it:line options}{cmd:)}} 
Provides options to be used in the "twoway line" part of the graph. This controls 
aspects of the point estimates. 
The default options are pstyle(p1) lwidth(0.3)
{p_end}

{synopt:{cmdab:twopt}{cmd:(}{it:twoway options}{cmd:)}} 
Provides options to be used on the "twoway" graph. This controls
aspects of the twoway graph, after combining rarea and line. 
The default option is to set the graph and plot region margins to vsmall {p_end}

{synopt:{cmdab:grcopt}{cmd:(}{it:graph combine options}{cmd:)}} 
Provides options to be used along with "graph combine". This controls 
aspects for the combined graph of all coefficients. {p_end}

{synopt:{it:graph combine options}}It is no longer needed to provide Graph combine options with grcopt(). One can simply add any of those options directly in the command line. This controls 
aspects for the combined graph of all coefficients. However, if you are plotting a single coefficient, it will affect the {help twoway options} {p_end}

{synopt:{cmdab:estore}{cmd:(}{it:name}{cmd:)}} Request to save all estimated coefficients 
and CI in e(). This will be stored in memory under {it: name }. This could be used later on
for plotting coefficients only, without re-estimating the quantile regressions. One could also Save this results in a file as a ster file. See {help estimates save}{p_end}

{synopt:{cmdab:from}{cmd:(}{it:name}{cmd:)}} Request to plot quantile coefficients using
the information previously stored in e(). 
When this option is used, one graph aspects options can be used. {p_end}
 
{synopt:{cmdab:label}} Request the use variable (or value) labels to be used as titles
for each individual quantile plot. The default option is to use the variable name. {p_end}
 
{synopt:{cmdab:labelopt(}options{cmd:)}} Provides additional information to handle "long"
variable labels. The two options are: {p_end} 
{synopt:} - {cmd:lines(#L)} Request to break a label into #L lines. {p_end} 
{synopt:} - {cmd:maxlength(#k)} Request to break a label into lines of maxlength #k. 
This be superseeded by lines if #k is too small to break a label into #L lines. {p_end} 
{synopt:{cmd:mtitles(titles)}}One also has the option of providing titles for each sub-graph. They should be written within double quotes. For exaple mtitles("first" "second") will use 'first' and 'second' as title graphs. See examples for details.{p_end}

{p 4} This program was created as a companion for {help rifhdreg}, for making it easier
to plot coefficients across different quantiles, but also as an answer to a regular question
regarding plotting dummies with {help grqreg} when using factor notation. {p_end}

{p 4} This program requires ftools, for expanding varlists with factor notation.{p_end}
