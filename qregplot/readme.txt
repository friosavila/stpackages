TITLE
      'qregplot': Module for ploting quantile regression coefficients.

DESCRIPTION/AUTHOR(S)
      
	'qregplot' is a command that plots quantile regression coefficients that are produced by a large set of popular "quantile regression" commands including -qreg-, -bsqreg-, -qreg2-, -rifhdreg-, among others. 
	This command works in a similar way as -grqreg-, but provides more control on how plots look, allowing for the use of factor notation (if the underlying command allows it). It can also be used to "save" quantile regression results in e().
