TITLE
      'ridgeline_plot': Module to create ridgeline/stack/stream plots.

DESCRIPTION/AUTHOR(S)
      
	'joy_plot' is a command that can be used to create ridgeline plots. It also comes with functions
that could easily enable you to produce stackline plots, or stream plots.
	These are plots for a single variable across different categories, often across time.
However, one can also use other variables in the horizonatl axis (age for example).
This command also allows you to easily use or change colors with colorpalette options (if installed).
