TITLE
      VC_PACK: Commands for the estimation of smooth varying coefficient models

DESCRIPTION/AUTHOR(S)

Nonparametric regressions are powerful statistical tools to model relationships between dependent and independent variables with minimal assumptions on the underlying functional forms. However, the added flexibility creates a curse of dimensionality, an induces a high computational cost in samples with even moderate sizes. As an alternative, semiparametric models that combine the flexibility of nonparametric regressions with the structure of standard models. VC_pack provides commands for the estimation of smooth varying-coefficient model (Hastie and Tibshirani, 1993, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B 55: 757â€“796), based on kernel regression methods, using a new set of commands within that aim to facilitate bandwidth selection and model estimation as well as create visualizations of the results.
