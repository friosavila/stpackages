TITLE
      'MMQREG': Estimation of quantile regressions via Method of Moments

DESCRIPTION/AUTHOR(S)
     
    'mmqreg' estimates quantile regressions using the method of moments as proposed by  Machado and Santos Silva (2019).
In contrast with -xtqreg-, this command allows for the estimation of quantile regressions without fixed effects, as well
as when multiple fixed effects are used.
