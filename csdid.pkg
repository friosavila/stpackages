d 'CSDID': module for the estimation of Difference-in-Difference models with multiple time periods
d
d  CSDID implements Callaway and Sant'Anna (2020) estimator for DID
d models with multiple time periods. The main idea of CSDID is that
d consistent estimations for ATT's can be obtained by ignoring 2x2
d DID design that compare late treated units with earlier treated
d units. In the presence of heterogeneous and dynamic effects, this
d type of comparison can severely bias the estimation of Treatment
d effects. CSDID at its core uses DRDID for the estimation of all
d 2x2 DID designs to estimate all relevant ATTGT's (Average
d treatment effects of the treated for group G at time T). Post
d estimation commands can be used to obtain important aggregations.
d CSDID can be used with panel data and repeated cross-section.Â
