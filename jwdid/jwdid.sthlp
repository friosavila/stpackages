{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:jwdid} is a program that implements the Extended TWFE estimator proposed by Jeff Wooldridge for the estimation of ATT's based on a generalized DID design. 

{pstd}In principle, this estimator simply suggests that to avoid some of the negative aspects of the traditional TWFE-DID estimator, which uses already treated units as controls causing the so-called negative weights, one should simply use a fully interacted set of dummies allowing for treatment effect heterogeneity by cohort and timing. 

{pstd}Specifically, instead of estimating a model as follows:

{pstd}y_it = gamma * D_it + a_i + b_t + e_t

{pstd}where D_it indicates if unit i is treated at time t. One should estimate a model like the following:

{pstd}y_it = sum(gamma_gt * G_i * t) + a_i + b_t + e_t

{pstd}where G_i * t corresponds to all possible interactions of the cohort unit i belongs to (G_i) and the period we aim to estimate that effect at (t). 

{pstd}In the simplest case, gamma_gt represents the ATT for cohort G at time t, and the estimates are comparable to the ones one could obtain using {cmd: csdid}.

{pstd}This command also allows you to add controls to the model, but those controls should be time invariant. The command will NOT verify that this is the case. 

{pstd}One should also be aware that {cmd: jwdid} will create as many interactions as cohorts and periods are there in the data, times all possible controls. 
This could provide an extreamly large number of estimated coefficients, which could make the models difficult to estimate.

{pstd}When using other estimation methods using {cmd: method()}, the program will assume group/cohort fixed effects only, instead of individual fixed effects. Mostly, this is to avoid the incidental parameter problem.

{pstd}The default comparison group only the interactions of cohort and time AFTER treatment occurred are included in the specification. This effectively uses not-yet treated as controls. When using the option {cmd:never}, all posible interactions of cohort 
and time are used, thus considering only the never treated as controls. The results from this are equivalent to Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021) and {cmd: csdid}, and the proposition by Sun and Abraham (2021). 

{marker remarks}{...}
{title:Remarks}

{pstd}
The first version of this command came out as one of my attempts of learning some of the new DID methods. 
For a while, most of my efforts were centered on {cmd:drdid} and {cmd:csdid}. 
However, the methodology proposed by Prof. Wooldridge has important advantages over other methods, which called my applied econometrician's attention. 

{pstd}The two most important advantages are: 

{phang2}1. It is based on regression analysis, and most people understand regression, compared to the other alternatives

{phang2}2. It is flexible for other methods. Namely, you should be easily be able to apply it for binary or count models (or other methods yet untested?)

{pstd}Also, this program was coded independently from Jeff Wooldridge, but mostly based on some of his simulation codes he shared with the community. 
Thus all errors of interpretation, and re-implementation (some of my own views on it) are my own. 
If you see an error or bug, Please let me know.

{pstd}And of course, there are now other two options to do the same in Stata. In Stata18, they lunch -xthdidregress- and -hdidregress-, which have the option 
to estimate DID models using the same approach. And most recently, someone developed -wooldid-. Lots of options! but I still like mine better! Just saying.
