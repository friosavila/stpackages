	abstract = {In this article, we consider identification, estimation, and inference procedures for treatment effect parameters using Difference-in-Differences (DiD) with (i) multiple time periods, (ii) variation in treatment timing, and (iii) when the “parallel trends assumption” holds potentially only after conditioning on observed covariates. We show that a family of causal effect parameters are identified in staggered DiD setups, even if differences in observed characteristics create non-parallel outcome dynamics between groups. Our identification results allow one to use outcome regression, inverse probability weighting, or doubly-robust estimands. We also propose different aggregation schemes that can be used to highlight treatment effect heterogeneity across different dimensions as well as to summarize the overall effect of participating in the treatment. We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators and prove the validity of a computationally convenient bootstrap procedure to conduct asymptotically valid simultaneous (instead of pointwise) inference. Finally, we illustrate the relevance of our proposed tools by analyzing the effect of the minimum wage on teen employment from 2001–2007. Open-source software is available for implementing the proposed methods.},

This equivalence furthers our understanding of the anatomy of TWFE, and has several applications. The equivalence between TWFE and TWM implies that various estimators used for intervention analysis – with a common entry time into treatment or staggered entry, with or without covariates – can be computed using TWFE or pooled OLS regressions that control for time-constant treatment intensities, covariates, and interactions between them. The approach allows considerable heterogeneity in treatment effects across treatment intensity, calendar time, and covariates. The equivalence implies that standard strategies for heterogeneous trends are available to relax the common trends assumption. Further, the two-way Mundlak regression is easily adapted to nonlinear models such as exponential models and logit and probit models.},

	abstract = {Summary
            I derive simple, flexible strategies for difference-in-differences settings where the nature of the response variable may warrant a nonlinear model. I allow for general staggered interventions, with and without covariates. Under an index version of parallel trends, I show that average treatment effects on the treated (ATTs) are identified for each cohort and calendar time period in which a cohort was subjected to the intervention. The pooled quasi-maximum likelihood estimators in the linear exponential family extend pooled ordinary least squares estimation of linear models. By using the conditional mean associated with the canonical link function, imputation and pooling across the entire sample produce identical estimates. Generally, pooled estimation results in very simple computation of the ATTs and their standard errors. The leading cases are a logit functional form for binary and fractional outcomes—combined with the Bernoulli quasi-log likelihood (QLL)—and an exponential mean combined with the Poisson QLL.},

We show that conventional regression-based estimators fail to provide unbiased estimates of relevant estimands absent strong restrictions on treatment-effect homogeneity. We then derive the efficient estimator addressing this challenge, which takes an intuitive “imputation” form when treatment-effect heterogeneity is unrestricted. We characterize the asymptotic behaviour of the estimator, propose tools for inference, and develop tests for identifying assumptions. Our method applies with time-varying controls, in triple-difference designs, and with certain non-binary treatments. We show the practical relevance of our results in a simulation study and an application. Studying the consumption response to tax rebates in the U.S., we find that the notional marginal propensity to consume is between 8 and 11\\% in the first quarter—about half as large as benchmark estimates used to calibrate macroeconomic models—and predominantly occurs in the first month after the rebate.}",

	abstract = {I propose a feasible and computationally efficient estimator of linear models with multiple levels of fixed effects. First, I show that solving the two–way fixed effects model is equivalent to solving a linear system on a weighted graph, and apply recent advances in spectral graph theory to obtain a nearly–linear time estimator (Kelner et al, 2013). Second, I embed this estimator into an improved version of the generalized within–estimator of Guimarães and Portugal (2010) and Gaure (2013), replacing their projections with symmetric ones amenable to conjugate gradient acceleration, guaranteeing monotonic convergence. The proposed estimator has the fastest known asymptotic running time, and performs particularly well with large datasets and high–dimensional fixed effects. Morever, by combining insights from graph theory, it opens the door to further improvements on the estimation and inference of models with multi–way fixed effects.},

We provide a novel characterization: the parallel trends assumption holds under all strictly monotonic transformations of the outcome if and only if a stronger “parallel trends”‐type condition holds for the cumulative distribution function of untreated potential outcomes. This condition for parallel trends to be insensitive to functional form is satisfied if and essentially only if the population can be partitioned into a subgroup for which treatment is effectively randomly assigned and a remaining subgroup for which the distribution of untreated potential outcomes is stable over time. These conditions have testable implications, and we introduce falsification tests for the null that parallel trends is insensitive to functional form.},

Because the code is built around the reghdfe package (Correia, 2014, Statistical Software Components S457874, Department of Economics, Boston College), it has similar syntax, supports many of the same functionalities, and benefits from reghdfe‘s fast convergence properties for computing high-dimensional leastsquares problems. Performance is further enhanced by some new techniques we introduce for accelerating HDFE iteratively reweighted least-squares estimation specifically. ppmlhdfe also implements a novel and more robust approach to check for the existence of (pseudo)maximum likelihood estimates.},
